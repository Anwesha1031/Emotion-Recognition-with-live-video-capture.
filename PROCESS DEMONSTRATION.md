Create a face recognition and emotion recognition with live video capture


## INTRODUCTION
Face emotion recognition is a rapidly advancing field in computer vision that aims to automatically detect and classify the emotional states of individuals from facial expressions. This technology has a wide range of applications, from human-computer interaction to mental health monitoring.

## OVERVIEW OF COMPUTER VISION (CV) AND DEEPFACE

### COMPUTER VISION
CV is the field of study that enables computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos, allowing them to perform tasks such as facial recognition, object detection, and scene understanding.

### DEEPFACE
Deepface is a deep learning-based facial analysis system that can detect facial landmarks, recognize faces, and classify facial expressions with high accuracy. It is a powerful tool for emotion recognition applications.

## ALGORITHM

The algorithm can be broken down into 3 major steps:

    1. Face Detection - Locating faces in the scene, in an image or video footage
    2. Facial Landmark Detection - Extracting information about facial features from detected faces (eg: end of nose, eyebrows, etc.)
    3. Facial Expression and Emotion Classification - Analyzing the movement of facial features and/or changes in the appearance of facial features and classifying this information into 6 basic categories (i.e. anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise)

Ways to implement the algorithm:

    1. Using OpenCV libraries
    2. Using Deepface libraries
    3. Using TensorFlow Keras libraries
    4. Building a DL model from scratch and training it on the dataset


## APPLICATIONS

1. Personalized services in smart environments

    1. movie/music recommendations
    2. interactive marketing, advertising
    3. mood-based personal assistants and many more


2. Healthcare

    1. to detect Autism or neurodegenerative diseases
    2. predict psychotic disorders or depression
    3. observe patients and their conditions during treatment, etc.


3. Education

    1. monitor students’ attention
    2. design affective tutoring system
    3. detect engagement in online learning, etc.


4. Public Safety & Crime Detection

    1. lie detectors and smart border control
    2. detect and reduce frauds
    3. predictive screening of public spaces to identify emotions    triggering potential terrorism threat
    4. driver fatigue detection to prevent accidents, etc.

## CONCLUSION

Face emotion recognition is a powerful tool with a wide range of applications. Advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of these systems. Ongoing  research aims to improve emotion recognition in more challenging environments, integrate it with other modalities (e.g., speech, text), and explore its applications in areas like mental health and human-robot interaction.
